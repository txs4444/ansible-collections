# Ansible Collections
This repository contains different collections I created for myself to use with VMs or to configure my OS.
In case someone can find it useful I'll try to keep it well documented.

# Collections
List of collections:
* [txs4444.archlinux](archlinux/README.md) - miscellaneous roles for Arch Linux
* [txs4444.generic](generic/README.md) - miscellaneous roles for Linux with no particular distribution in mind

# Usage
TBD
